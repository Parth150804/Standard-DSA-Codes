# Standard DSA Codes

Welcome to Standard DSA Codes! This repository contains implementations of various standard data structures and algorithms (DSA) in C++ for your reference and use. Below is an overview of what you can find in this repository:

## Data Structures
1. **Heap**
   - Implementation of a binary heap data structure along with heap operations like insertion, deletion, and heapify.

2. **Trie**
   - Implementation of a trie data structure for efficient string storage and retrieval operations.

3. **Hashtable and Hashing**
   - Implementation of a hashtable using open addressing and chaining techniques, along with various hashing functions.

4. **Graphs**
   - Implementation of basic graph data structure and algorithms including traversal, shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's and Floyd Warshall, topological sort, and Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components.

## Algorithms
1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
   - Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

2. **Floyd Warshall Algorithm**
   - Implementation of Floyd Warshall algorithm for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.

3. **Topological Sort**
   - Implementation of topological sorting algorithm for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

4. **Tarjan's Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**
   - Implementation of Tarjan's algorithm to find all strongly connected components in a directed graph.

5. **Optimal Meeting Point**
   - Implementation of an algorithm to find the optimal meeting point for a group of people in a city grid based on minimizing the total distance traveled.

Feel free to explore each directory for detailed implementations, example usage, and any additional resources. These codes can serve as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing common DSA concepts and algorithms.
